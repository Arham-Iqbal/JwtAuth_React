# Authentication System with JWT

## Overview
This is a simple authentication system built with React that allows users to sign up, log in, and access a protected dashboard. The application utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and local storage to manage user sessions.

## Features
- User Sign Up
- User Login
- Protected Routes (Dashboard)
- JWT-based authentication
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Notifications using React Hot Toast

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authentication-system.git
   cd authentication-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Sign Up
1. Navigate to the **Signup** page.
2. Enter a username, password, and confirm your password.
3. Click the **Signup** button to create an account.

### Login
1. Navigate to the **Login** page.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Click the **Submit** button to log in.

### Accessing the Dashboard
- After logging in, you will be redirected to the **Dashboard**, where you can see your welcome message.
- You can log out using the **Log Out** button.

## Protecting Routes
The `Dashboard` route is protected. If a user is not authenticated (i.e., no JWT token in local storage), they will be redirected to the **Login** page when trying to access the dashboard.
